5a5e50f3be6796001a9d7316,"PROs: This module represents for the student the first chance to face independent synthetical work from A to Z. You learn (or often, you self-learn) how to do literature research, perform syntheses under exclusion of air/water/light, purify the substances by means of different methods and get the chance to perform a full characterisation of the synthesized product. It is therefore a module which really teaches you a lot. The majority of the teaching assistants involved took their job responsibly and invested a lot of time to correct the laboratory reports properly (and there are MANY criteria of corrections set for this course). CONs: this module is always overbooked. There aren‚Äôt enough places for everybody, so there‚Äôs a rotating place system with a computational week course to periodically reduce the number of people present in the lab. It‚Äôs a shame that the university is making new chemistry buildings here near Irchel, but they don‚Äôt intend to sacrifice a little bit of the new space for the bachelor students, so the situation probably won‚Äôt change in the future. Another con of this laboratory course is the important time pressure and the inevitable scarcity of solvents/reagents along with huge waiting times to perform every single spectroscopical measurement. Another frustrating fact is the very long list of criteria with which your work is strictly evaluated, which leaves you with the impression that whatever quality of work you do, it will be regarded as only ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù due to very small details. But bear in mind that it‚Äôs like that because the quality standards in the research world are really high and it‚Äôs the first time that you have to learn everything at once.  To anybody who has to do this module I‚Äôd say: 1) Don‚Äôt get scared by the bad reviews of this module. It‚Äôs true that there is a lot of stress sometimes, but it‚Äôs still very doable if you plan your schedule. 2) Make a daily schedule of what you‚Äôre going to do in the lab every day (I.e. synthesis/purification/characterisation) 3) do literature research and plan the synthesis discussion with your TA as soon as possible 4) go to the lab every single available day 5) plan to register yourself in the waiting lists for the spectrometers already 1/2 days in advance 6) if the liquid nitrogen tank is empty, contact immediately the ‚Äúbetriebsdienst‚Äù via telephone so that they will refill it. If solvents are missing, say it immediately to the TAs 7) be prepared to put aside other modules and give full priority to this module. I think it‚Äôs better not having to repeat this than other modules of the same semester.",3,UZH,50772388,3.0,0.0,1578223557075,CHE 212 Practical course in Synthetic Chemistry,Practical course in Synthetic Chemistry

5a5f18d6be6796001a9d9106,"Review 2021: Overall an interesting but tough course. You‚Äôll have to get used to a lot of new mathematical notation and some lengthy derivations and proofs during the lectures (containing mathematical contents which have not been taught to such extent in undergrad Econ in Z√ºrich e.g. fix-Point Theorems and Hyperplane Separation etc.). The course feels to ambitious especially towards the end- way too much content in a very short time span. Lecturer is average and quite monotone and often rushes through the material due to time pressure. Exercise sessions were nice and quite useful for insights and exam preparation- beware they get progressively harder. In general the course requires a high workload and is amongst the toughest subjects at WWF in Z√ºrich. Exam is manageable with comprehensive preparation but requires a lot of transfer knowledge. Also be aware of the fact that in certain years the lecturers tend to give huge weights to exercises in the exam which were barely covered in the course and did not seem that relevant (this I must say was quite disappointing). Up to 40% fail the course- however a good median estimate would probably lie around 25% which is still a lot for a 5th semester course. Some interesting topics, a decent TA, average lecturer, provided materials are alright, exam tough but manageable- very difficult to get outstanding grades.

The exam wasn't fair at all: students were told to focus on the homework because the exam would have had the same style, but that was objectively false. In fact, the 4 grade was put at really low points and despite this a lot of people who did great in the homework failed. I wonder what's the sense behind doing an extremely difficult exam and put sufficiency very low instead of doing one with easy exercises just to reach a 4 and then more difficult ones in order to get a better grade. A Mock Exam would have been much appreciated, so that people could have had an idea of what to expect, but the Professor didn't want to make one.

The seminar was very useful and covered lots of interesting facts. I actually enjoyed reading a selection of medieval texts and I like that I am able to grasp how English developed the way it did. Although not everyone might find Old and Middle English useful, this class offers an interesting insight into something quite unique for your studies.

5a686abbc9e055001ac8a158,"Worst course ever. Very bad. It was done the first time this year by prof. Meyer, but the course was not structured at all. Like we sometimes didn't know if we had exercise lessons on certain days. And if we did we got a mail with the information one day before. The slides were incomplete, he jumped a lot between the slides and the slides he was discussing were rarely on his website. Comparing them with the slides of HS16 (which are absolutely great and crystal clear), they were just horrible and unnecessarily bloated with useless information. He should learn something from his predecessor. The prof. made us use his programming language Eiffel which made the whole project unneceasarily time consuming. His arguments on why we should use it were just BAD. It's  obvious that he wanted to shove it down our throats so his language could get more popular. We didn't even benefit slightly by using his language. I could go on forever why this course was so bad. However, it still got 2 stars because of the only 2 good concepts we learned during the course.

Additionally, oral exam of 15min. about all the lectures, the jobs and the practical and then you'll have to write a report that will mever reach their expectations, no matter how much time you invested in it. Both, oral exam and report must be passed independently. For the report you will have two more weeks after the end of the BC.

5bf57ec282bfed001b1031a2,"This lecture single handedly worsens the quality and worth of your bachelor just like Bertrand Meyers lecture. Chaotic slides that leave you more confused instead of helping you and assistent & lecturer with a broken english. Google, youtube and even the books themselves are easier to understand than the words of the lecturer (not because of the english, but because of the unstructured, complicated mess). The lecturer does not provide more value... Horrible.  EDIT: Here is an in-depth update with additional points why this lecture was the worst lecture of my degree. I hope I didn't forget anything.   - While learning for the exam I noticed that all the slide sets had multiple errors in them. Really embarrassing. They got updated, but only some of them got fixed. How hard can it be to copy paste formulas from a book?  - Also the lecturer just took down all the slides 1 day before the exam without any prewarning. I was still learning and luckily I knew some people who still had some versions of the slides.  - The lecturer told us we need half of the points in the exercise to be allowed to the final exam. But they didn't tell us how many points there were until the very end.  - 5 minutes before the final exam, some PCs were not working. Instead of finding a solution, they just ignored the problems of the affected students and started the exam without giving the affected students time to prepare their computers. This lead to unfair conditions...  - Lecturer and Assistant were talking during the exam, which made it more difficult to focus. Someone had to tell them to go outside to continue with their talking before they stopped talking.  - No cheat sheet was allowed, so we had to learn all complicated formulas and algorithms by heart. It's unnecessary and pointless to learn dozens of formulas that you'll forget a few days after the exam.  - The ONLY positive thing was that the lecturer provided additional notes for the topics... but only weeks after people were asking her to provide us more information and the source of her slides. Without the notes it was impossible to understand anything.   It's such a shame. The topics are actually  interesting and could have been helpful in your career.

5c3f5ddecaa3e7001c6b3c2f,"Personal Branding is a progressive style of lecture that was certainly hard to pull through regarding the rather conservative regulations of UZH. Every slide (total ~1‚Äò600) is made by hand without any template. I personally enjoyed this very much so as it, among others, displays modern trends.  The lecture was meant for people that truly are into the topic. If you were, then the slides yielded great amount of knowledge, including application demos to driectly implement into real life. If you were NOT interested and mainly booked it as a ‚Äûfiller‚Äú, then the content was overloading. However, to the people being irritated, the professor explicitely said in the first lecture (and it‚Äòs even written on the syllabus) that it‚Äòs going to be a s***load of information.  Imho, the exam was fair. When knowing all slides with (!), it shouldn‚Äòt have been an issue to pass. Although, there were some tricky questions where extended knowledge was required. Yet, I don‚Äòt think that he brutally asked for some minor, irrelevant detail but kept the focus on the big picture. Also, have you ever written an exam in Business having more than enough time to solve? Me neither, expect for this one.  Conclusion: Very ambitious and well-respected professor that goes against the traditional, conservative style of teaching. This lecture doesn‚Äòt teach formulas to forecast how many millions you‚Äòll earn later on but it teaches you something about yourself. He used phrases like ‚ÄûWhat would you do if money was no object‚Äú and ‚ÄûMoney follows happiness‚Äú that may sound super instagrammy but are of value if you truly start to think about it. Reading tipp: Man‚Äòs Search For Meaning - Viktor Frankl  I liked the lecture a lot and hope to see more open-minded professors and progressive lecture styles.

It is like teaching you plus and minus, when the assignments expect you to do double integrals only with the help of google. If you want to punish yourself because you like pain or whatever (or if you don't care about grades, desperately need credits in this field and can't get a proper course or you have a crush on a person who is attending) and still take this course, you better learn how to google properly and maybe look at the slides on your own (looking at slides: optional).   Assignments are not about coding:  As a hint for the assignments: make sure to get a psychology and telekinesis class before that otherwise you will be lost and helpless when interpreting the questions correctly. The questions are posted very ambigious and Meusel is very proud of that since this is the only way he can make this course difficult even for people who are no coding beginners. Knowing how to throw cards could be as useful as throwing code, if not even more.  In case you have no skill (see above) I would suggest you write down the possible interpretations on a paper and then you throw a black dice on the paper to pick an interpretation. The dice has to be black because this course is black humour.  Organisation: do you enjoy having assignments with a LOT of multiple choice questions about detailed, hard-to-acquire knowledge that is nowhere to be found in the web? Do you like it even more if the 5 pages of lecture slides about this topic are as informative as the latest ""Jolie"" is about politics? In this course you can have that all, plus you will have the possibility to sometimes enjoy having these kind of assignments BEFORE the lecture about this topic even took place.

Yes, the ""exercise"" hour that they have in the description of this module is basically an additional hour that most of the lecturers have used to just carry on with the theory. Only on 2 occasions were there live patient demonstrations, which is an absolute joke because this was advertised as the main perk of this lecture to me. The exam was alright; depending on what you focused on during revision, you could have found it anywhere from easy to ""seriously?! Out of all things you could have asked you ask this?!"". My personal issue with the exam was that it seemed a bit one-sided (with so many questions on the symptoms) and also the wording of a few questions was either unclear or misleading. My tips would be to definitely attend the Parkinson's lecture (this one was actually quite good but the main reason you need to be there is that there are no slides!) and memorize all the symptoms (which I didn't do as thoroughly as I should have). Although I've said so many negative things, I'm still giving this module a score of 3 because some of the lectures were actually good and clear and because there are certainly modules out there that are much worse.

The topics give a solid overview and you need to understand the inner workings of some algorithms (e.g. search algorithms or backpropagation in neural nets).   But the way they teach you the topics is just awful. There are way too many guest lecturers (5) which makes the lecture slides even more inconsistent/random than they already are. Expect to learn mostly from the internet when preparing for the exam. Check out last years OLAT course to have a look at the slides.  The practical exercise where quite some work, but ok - assignment 1 was by far the most time consuming. The theory questions are a mess though, they are exactly the same as last year and they had tons of mistakes back then. Instead of correcting them, they just reuploaded them as-is this year again, resulting in a class-forum that was filled with complaints.  Because of lack of alternatives, I would take this class again. If you're a Data Science major, take it. If you're just interested in AI - i.e. you write ""Machine Learning Enthusiast"" in your CV - read the book, it's the de-facto bible of this field (Artificial Intelligence - A modern approach by Russel & Norvig).

5d83973005a308001c487969,"Please do not take this course. I totally regretted it.   Most of us took it because we thought they were very generous in the grading due to the reviews from the previous years. Reasons are following: -Basically, the whole course was just run by TAs.  -Really demanding for a 6 ECTS seminar. High standards (equivalent to that of a Masters/ PhD thesis) were expected to produce a literature review. Need to come up with your own research topic with minimal guidance. In the event that feedback was provided, TA actually counted the number of times he offered us help and the suggestions he provided us regarding our work, and took this into account when grading. -Mismatch of expectations throughout the whole course. TA didn‚Äôt tell us explicitly that we needed to use the two papers he provided as a basis to formulate the research question, and penalised us really harshly for this in the research proposal. Initially said that we can consult TA for at least two times, then after two times TA said this is the last time. Somehow I felt that they were being lazy about consultations. Following which, we later on our own initiative submitted a draft of our work so that it serves as a foundation for our discussion during consultations. During the feedback given after grading our final work, TA mentioned that we should not give him a draft but instead said that we should have submitted our draft in point forms. However this wasn‚Äôt communicated clearly in any way prior to the consultation. During our final presentation, we had the impression that it all went well from the response they gave us. So throughout this course, it mainly seemed like it went well except for the research proposal part until we received the grades. -Presentation scores given were really low compared to a lot of other seminars. They seemed to be unexpectedly strict with grading.   In a summary, its not worth it for 6 ECTS. We put in a lot of effort for this course but it did not translate to grades. There are other seminar courses that would make your effort more worthwhile, or some even required lesser effort to translate to better grades. Take two 3 ECTS courses instead.

First assignments appear on the horizon and make you realize how dreadful & nerve-racking mathematica really is. Lovely software (with non-existent online community where one normally finds solutions) is accompanied by assignment questions that make you spend precious time staring into void thinking what exactly you are asked to do. It is mid-semester and you realize that you learned very little (to nothing) new so far. Prof switches from slow-mode to rushing through the numerous course materials that only cover a scratch of surface of statistics (course could be much better paced).  4) It is semester-end and you know that you learned very little (to nothing) new so far (excl. mathematica codes which will never cross my path again I hope). End of lecture period is marked by coding-heavy, time-pressured midterm full of tricky questions where you feel that it would be better to know less and get 0 points than know more but not quite enough and fall for tricky tricks (and get negative points).

5e11c29064553b001ec4a255,"PROs: This module represents for the student the first chance to face independent synthetical work from A to Z. You learn (or often, you self-learn) how to do literature research, perform syntheses under exclusion of air/water/light, purify the substances by means of different methods and get the chance to perform a full characterisation of the synthesized product. It is therefore a module which really teaches you a lot. The majority of the teaching assistants involved took their job responsibly and invested a lot of time to correct the laboratory reports properly (and there are MANY criteria of corrections set for this course). CONs: this module is always overbooked. There aren‚Äôt enough places for everybody, so there‚Äôs a rotating place system with a computational week course to periodically reduce the number of people present in the lab. It‚Äôs a shame that the university is making new chemistry buildings here near Irchel, but they don‚Äôt intend to sacrifice a little bit of the new space for the bachelor students, so the situation probably won‚Äôt change in the future. Another con of this laboratory course is the important time pressure and the inevitable scarcity of solvents/reagents along with huge waiting times to perform every single spectroscopical measurement. Another frustrating fact is the very long list of criteria with which your work is strictly evaluated, which leaves you with the impression that whatever quality of work you do, it will be regarded as only ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù due to very small details. But bear in mind that it‚Äôs like that because the quality standards in the research world are really high and it‚Äôs the first time that you have to learn everything at once.  To anybody who has to do this module I‚Äôd say: 1) Don‚Äôt get scared by the bad reviews of this module. It‚Äôs true that there is a lot of stress sometimes, but it‚Äôs still very doable if you plan your schedule. 2) Make a daily schedule of what you‚Äôre going to do in the lab every day (I.e. synthesis/purification/characterisation) 3) do literature research and plan the synthesis discussion with your TA as soon as possible 4) go to the lab every single available day 5) plan to register yourself in the waiting lists for the spectrometers already 1/2 days in advance 6) if the liquid nitrogen tank is empty, contact immediately the ‚Äúbetriebsdienst‚Äù via telephone so that they will refill it. If solvents are missing, say it immediately to the TAs 7) be prepared to put aside other modules and give full priority to this module. I think it‚Äôs better not having to repeat this than other modules of the same semester.",3,UZH,50772388,2.0,0.0,1578223557075,CHE 212 Practical course in Synthetic Chemistry,Practical course in Synthetic Chemistry

The group project would suddenly account for 50% of the grade and would encompass a lot of work plus a final 20min presentation (graded). - last class was especially useless (just Advertisement lol); he presented a page he and his pals made to trade some cryptos with slides that did not explain anything useful and advertised how to buy shares of his lawier-brother‚Äôs yet not very profitable company he deserted and left to our teacher. I mean who knows, maybe one of us has already a fortune and wants to lend him some money (possible in zurich) - during the presentations he sometimes looked through the window - very very disrespectful!  - grades received with no feedback at all including last exercise not even graded separately... all smells like a lot of ‚ÄòImma lift ma finga inda air‚Äô arbitrariness...  all in all it was a course I would be ashamed to talk about in a job interview because I invested time, learned nothing (but to google, again...), used up time I could have used for something that actually produces some value for professional life and in the end, I think courses like this lower the overall quality of the university and its a shame for all the PhDs in the same programm who are more capable.

Regarding fairness of the exam: In the end, the exam was manageable to ok but a real pain in the neck to study because only studying theory in a subject that has no use for personal development is kind of frustrating.

5e1dbcf1c2171a001ee903bf,"Honestly one of the best courses I had so far throughout uni! First: I had to make a large effort but had the perhaps highest learning outcome so far. Prof. Crawford manages it to teach a subject that primarily consists of statistical foundations and mathematical derivations in a matter that is more interesting than many other professors of more ‚Äûapplied‚Äú subjects. So even though you expect the subject to be really boring, it (mostly) is the opposite. Of course, the effort you have to make with the 4 Problem Sets is higher compared to many other courses, but to my mind they were really useful in both explaining us some of the central ideas of the theory and helping us to implement the theory into practice with software code. It was the first time I was able to understand practical implications from theory and connect both areas. And he always puts intuition into the formulas and attempts to explain math with logic and economic theory. The exam was harder than last year (which was this year‚Äòs mock exam I reckon) but still well manageable if you study. So no really unfair surprises. Overall, you were able to sense that Crawford and the TA‚Äòs actually make an effort and want us to understand what the subject is about. It‚Äôs really nice to have competent people that teach us a subject which serves as a basis to so many different fields in economics and finance.

Some peers already mentioned how this is more of an english-I-can-read-your-mind test than anything else so I will not elaborate on this.   Exam way harder than in the previous years and change of exam rules in the last minute: they always said we can use the internet since it is an open book exam - just before the start of the exam, they said we were not allowed to use the internet, except for sylva of course and the documentation center of wolfram (goodbye stackoverflow).  Since only the results count and even a very little rounding mistake will cost you all the points of the question, even solving all or most of the questions does not leave some feeling of security about the probability of passing the course because you never know.   Therefore this course does not distinguish between someone who knew nothing and someone who made a little mistake.  Whether you pass or not will also have nothing to do with whether you understand the topics of the class btw.  Don‚Äôt let yourself be fooled - because the topics are easy, they need to be creative in order to make it hard (and yep, they were, this semester). If it wasn‚Äôt mandatory I would never take thus course again, and I hope I pass so I don‚Äôt have to go through this torture of an exam again.

5ed11a877bf2720022f6298f,"Quite nice course with some negative aspects. David is competent and also likes teaching, which is apparent from both his lecture style and content. The difficulty level is rather low. You cover the most prevalent inference techniques and apply them in the problem sets. It‚Äòs a slight extension to Empirical Methods, but mainly from an application-based and not theoretical / conceptual standpoint. So don‚Äòt expect to thoroughly understand the concepts of each chapter. Another goodie was that he wants us to be able to explain the concepts and results in easy language and, as such, also attempts to communicate in this language. One thing which kind of annoyed me was his level of self-satisfaction (he has this typical ‚ÄûI‚Äòm the smartest guy in the room‚Äú attitude to which I am allergic to). Overall, the course is ok / good but my main concern was that there are other courses which are far heavier but for which learning outcome is far greater (famous example of Prof. Birolli‚Äòs course). So I think this course is good for anyone with no / very little experience in econometrics and who just wants to get an overview of the subject (which is why, I guess, so many students from Policy / Social Science Master programmes take it). But, if you like this field and really want to know what‚Äòs going on, don‚Äòt take it. ",3,UZH,50749029,0.0,0.0,1613667148483,Econometrics for Policy Analysts (L+E),Econometrics for Policy Analysts

Don‚Äòt be fooled, it‚Äòs not your average easy credit subject. Also in Top 3 of difficulty or work-effort, as it teaches the statistical concepts of every approach in great detail. The 7 problem sets as well as the twitter thread of the paper take a lot of time and individual research (each PS is 50% programing and 50% deriving the fundamental statistical frameworks, which are quite challenging and only doable in groups). Luckily we had a pretty decent group. Also the final project is quite time consuming. Still, it greatly prepares you for further research (master thesis, PhD even) and is the best choice if you actually wanna understand causal inference and combine technical expertise with qualitative analysis. PS: would combine it with econometrics for policy analysts, b/c if you can solve the exercises here, then the other subject is a piece of cake üòÖ",5,UZH,50575949,0.0,0.0,1590763428157,Program Evaluation and Causal Inference (L+E),Program Evaluation and Causal Inference

One of my biggest mistakes in my academic career so far! The papers covered in the lecture are very interesting and contain basic knowledge. The lecture slides could be less confusing and better organized but I have seen worse. But the tutorials were a pure nightmare! Full of mistakes, without structure and even the solutions we all received contained several (crucial) errors!!! How are we supposed to learn anything if the solutions are checked and corrected every other week? Even during the tutorial sessions the lecturer sometimes had to give up and simply told us: ""Yes, I'll just send you the solutions, it's easier that way"".

5f2025be56fb230022ad9c43,"Please do not take this course. I totally regretted it.   Most of us took it because we thought they were very generous in the grading due to the reviews from the previous years. Reasons are following: -Basically, the whole course was just run by TAs.  -Really demanding for a 6 ECTS seminar. High standards (equivalent to that of a Masters/ PhD thesis) were expected to produce a literature review. Need to come up with your own research topic with minimal guidance. In the event that feedback was provided, TA actually counted the number of times he offered us help and the suggestions he provided us regarding our work, and took this into account when grading. -Mismatch of expectations throughout the whole course. TA didn‚Äôt tell us explicitly that we needed to use the two papers he provided as a basis to formulate the research question, and penalised us really harshly for this in the research proposal. Initially said that we can consult TA for at least two times, then after two times TA said this is the last time. Somehow I felt that they were being lazy about consultations. Following which, we later on our own initiative submitted a draft of our work so that it serves as a foundation for our discussion during consultations. During the feedback given after grading our final work, TA mentioned that we should not give him a draft but instead said that we should have submitted our draft in point forms. However this wasn‚Äôt communicated clearly in any way prior to the consultation. During our final presentation, we had the impression that it all went well from the response they gave us. So throughout this course, it mainly seemed like it went well except for the research proposal part until we received the grades. -Presentation scores given were really low compared to a lot of other seminars. They seemed to be unexpectedly strict with grading.   In a summary, its not worth it for 6 ECTS. We put in a lot of effort for this course but it did not translate to grades. There are other seminar courses that would make your effort more worthwhile, or some even required lesser effort to translate to better grades. Take two 3 ECTS courses instead.

Next, you had to evaluate this expression for several values (which was something a 7yo could do (* & + of some numbers), but granted a lot of points due to the fact it took a lot of time).

600354f00ec03300229c0b38,"Well I‚Äòm speaking from the perspective of an econ / finance student with minor in data science so I probably don‚Äòt speak for everyone. Overall, the course was a very challenging but also rewarding experience. Prof. Olteanu provides you with a sound (or, rather, extensive) fundament for the world of data science / ML. You get the full programme, covering the necessary maths / statistics and then going over each of the most known ML techniques. The main focus of the lecture lays in providing the mathematical framework of each topic rather than giving in-depth application. So you don‚Äòt have any programming throughout either exercise or lecture session. It‚Äòs just plain math (and from time to time some intuition). However, credits to the lecturer, he was able to convey these theoretical concepts in a way that enabled me to (mostly) really understand the concepts behind. The exercise sessions were, to my mind, a waste of time. But the practicals were quite nice. That is, if you can actually program, otherwise they require ages (again speaking from an econ perspective). But overall, they were doable and really fostered my coding abilities. In general, it was one of the courses which taught me the most. But at the same time very time consuming - far too much for 6 ECTS! Roughly 50-70 slides each week with full on written content on each, 6 exercise sessions and 3 practicals, lectures mainly based on mathematical conceptions and on top an exam which was quite unfairly graded (I think most had around 50 / 100 points...). Also, the prof doesn‚Äòt have much empathy for our concerns regarding the amount of work and sometimes even appears quite cocky / arrogant (just like one of his TAs, not Ahmed though, he was nice and less ‚Äûrobot teacher style‚Äú). So, overall the course really outperforms in terms of content (5 stars) but should improve a lot when it comes to non-content related parts that make a subject enjoyable and worthwile (1-2 stars).

603c09f65f36aa0022f9c94a,"I think the prof is one of the best in explaining difficult subjects. Also he was very helpful when there was a question and answered the emails very fast. I liked that he repeated important points a few times so everyone understands the lecture.   Since it was the first time the exam was online, it had to be a bit more difficult than in the last years. Additionally, we were given less time for the same amount of questions. However, if you understood his lectures (which are explained very well) and solve the exercises and practice to be fast in solving equation systems, I think the exam is still fair. He just expected the students to answer all theoretical questions in their own words in order to proof that you understand the subjects (since it's open book just copying the formulas wouldn't make any sense)   I guess the problem which many students faced was the time constraint and not the difficulty of the questions. The mathematical questions were similar to those in the exercises but of course there were some new ones. However, the time constraint didn't really allow to solve the new ones, so that solving the already known kind of exercises and answering the theoretical questions was enough to get a very good grade (in my case: 5.5). I was able to solve about bit more than 2 of the 4 questions. My advice is to first solve every problem which is similar to the exercises and then the theoretical questions because they are awarded with the same points as the ""new"" questions. And since you won't be able to solve the whole exam anyway, you will at least have those questions correct which you were able to practice and this at least in my case was enough for the good grade.  In general, I can't really say whether you should take it or not because I don't know how the stuff learned it's useful.

603c11645f36aa0022f9c9d8,"I'm a banking&finance student with minor corporate finance so I decided to take this course since I'm very interested in the subject. As the prof tells in his introductory lesson, the lecture is supposed to be taken by business administration/Quant finance/management students who are not that familiar with corporate finance. He even said the course is not for b&f students. Nevertheless, I took the course and was quite surprised by the case studies. They were quite difficult, especially for my group members who never had had anything to do with finance before. Actually, with no help of other students who already have the necessary knowledge it's unsolvable.  What really made dislike this course is that often the questions in the case studies were asked in a such unclear way in order to artificially complicate the questions. Often it was not clear what we were required to do. The assistants who are supposed to help did not help at all. (are not allowed to answer)   Grading was random and depending on the assistants. Eventhough we were able to solve one case nearly perfectly, we got an average grade.   The lecture does not prepare the students for the cases. The knowledge needed to appropriately solve the cases requires having taken some finance / corporate finance courses. The lecture by the prof is actually really bad since he jumps from subject to subject and does not teach the students the needed basics. He rather focuses on learning the names of each student to ask them again and again if they understood or to cold call them.  Most of the time I could not understand what he expected us to answer since his way of teaching and asking questions was that unclear/confuse (as in the case studies). He should rather spend his time building a well structured lecture to teach corporate finance basics.   My opinion: I do not recommend the course to anyone who has no knowledge in corporate finance. Of course, if you have some group members who are able to help and solve the questions, then you are lucky. In case you don't, you will be lost. The lecture will not prepare you and since it's so unstructured you will finally not learn anything except for the names of all the students in the lecture.   I wouldn't recommend it to students with corporate finance knowledge either unless you know your group members or you are lucky to have a group where you actually can profit from the discussions and the knowledge of the others.  In my case, I had a group doing the bare minimum and not being interested in the subject (2 of them free riders and two with absolutely no knowledge and thus unfortunately of no help)   Thus, only take it if you have some friends who you know and who have the necessary knowledge to solve rather difficult case studies with often unclearly formulated questions.

60584d46cb3b6500224859e9,"I hadn't used much R that much before the course began. Only for some regressions and stuff like that. So I was a bit afraid that the course will be too hard for me. And it was quite stressful for a beginner because you have to practice whole day long and in the end of each day there is 15 programming minutes test which used to be hard for me. Furthermore, you will face some ""programming issues"" during the day which make the tight schedule even more stressful. However, Radu was great. He helped the students a lot and also some other students who are good in programming were really helpful.  Despite not being able to solve all the daily programming questions, I got a really good grade because there is theory exam in the end of the week which in my opinion was very fair and it accounts for 50% of the grade.   Additionally, 20% of the grade are the datacamp exercises for which you have 4 weeks time. And you will be able to get good results there.   So you shouldn't worry too much as a beginner.

It turnes out to be the worst decision of my academic career. He has very specific requirements and is not able to communicate them. Despite having written a research proposal were I described my problem in detail and another paper treated a similar problem he deemed the problem to be not complex enough in the end. Even though it was very hard to obtain my results and I invested nearly 4.5 months with training trying different algorithms. He even mentioned that for him in the end just the results count. The way how I got the results or how much I had to do to obtain them he doesnt care about. Very unscientific imo. I also have the strong suspicion that he has neither realy looked at my research proposal nor my thesis. Based on the demands he made I also have the strong suspicion that he never really applied reinforcement learning in an own project. Otherwise, I cant explain his complete lack of sympathy with my struggle to obtain results and his inability to make feasible and helpful suggestions.

Also, I suppose this is a consequence of the ‚Äúclinical‚Äù focus, but for some lectures the large focus was mostly on clinical symptoms and signs. I personally found the lecturers that went more into detail about neurobiology super fascinating and I learnt a lot from them. ALS-FTD, Spinal muscular atrophy, strokes, brain tumours and although was far to much content for the time slot were extremely interesting and the content was a good mixture of clinical symptoms and looked into depth regarding the pathology, particularly the first two.

First 7 weeks is given by Kuchulain (hope I got his name right), where you look at some very basic concepts on compatibility constraints, profit conditions and very basic models on banking theory that have absolutely nothing to do with reality, thus like microeconomics. Then, Ongena turns up and talks about something on regulation, financial intermediation and also tries to fill his arguments with some empirics - some of them are (somewhat) interesting, some boring as hell (actually, most is boring as hell to my mind). Both profs make an effort in trying to make this subject exciting and looking important in real-life, which it is to some limited extent. But they are motivated and want us to learn something, which I appreciate! Exam was certainly the easiest of all compulsory subjects. You were basically able to copy paste 90% directly from your summary (even calculation questions were the same as in the PS) and the remaining 10% were solveable by thinking logically - so easy credits to push your average.

The passing grade 4 will be at around 20-30% of the total points of the final exam depending on how good your fellow students are. They adjust the passing grade according to the results. Meaning, you can not learn enough. It‚Äòs all about how good you know the topics in detail and how fast you are solving the exam tasks. During the lessons you think it‚Äòs quite complex but the exercises and what they expect you to know is way more complex. If you want to be sure to pass the exam, just following the lessons and solving the exercises is not enough. You have to spend at least additional 4h only solving past exam questions or exercises for a topic each week to be really ready for the exam!  Pros: - Prof. B√∂hlen is teaching this module for years and Is extremely competent. Personally, I really like the way he is teaching and explaining things. His slides are working slides, so please make sure to write things down during the lessons. - As many others also mentioned, the topics are essential for being a good programmer and are mostly interesting.  Cons: - Exercise solutions do often have errors or typos in it which really can confuse you and steal time to think about why your solution is wrong but in fact their solution was wrong. So, better ask in the forum if the solution is wrong than trying to think about why your solution is wrong. - Exam questions are oftentimes misleading or vaguely described. You could explain a probem in 1-3 sentences but they are using half of a page. Maybe that is intentioned to push us to really filter the most important facts out of it. I can only advise you to first always make an example for yourself to grasp the problem in the rigth way. - There is only one good tutor: Christoph Vogel - The exam in general: There are mostly hard problems. If you don‚Äòt know topics in detail you have no chance to solve it. All people which are knowing the topics more or less good depend on luck during the exam.

The content is very interesting and enjoyable to learn, and the slides are very well done (except for the recurrences and rb trees). Some advice (i got 5.5): I found that it worked best to skip the classes and go through the material myself, as it is to hard to understand just watching someone do it. Be prepared to watch a lot of YouTube videos (Abdul Bari) to fill in the gaps. The exercises are quite hard but well thought, do them unless they are obnoxiously tedious. You need to practice a lot, just studying is not enough. The negative part is that you don‚Äôt need to be able to actually code on a computer, and the best strategy to pass the exam is to solve everything on paper and FAST during the semester.

In fact, the 4 grade was put at really low points and despite this a lot of people who did great in the homework failed. I wonder what's the sense behind doing an extremely difficult exam and put sufficiency very low instead of doing one with easy exercises just to reach a 4 and then more difficult ones in order to get a better grade.

The entire course builds on understanding visualisation concepts, but rarely anything is taught in practice. Rather, the professor insists on hammering some theoretical concepts into our brains which I was personally not able to convert into practice. To my mind, data vis concepts should be taught by practice. That is, just code and plot data, as much as possible. But instead of this, you get a weird book which explains everything in a far too complicated manner without much practical relevance. Typical BWL 1-3 type of study which is hell for most students. But at least the grading was very generous because it did not matter if you understand anything but if you choose the right terms, and then I guess you easily get a 5.5 or more.

61e461b71291260021610bc5,"One of the best courses of the bachelor. The formulas aren't just thrown in there like they fell from the sky, but everything is explained mathematically (and Hens is very good at it). The point of the course is to study the CAPM and its limitations, seeing for each of them how one can expand the model to make it as consistent as possible. Finally, the chapter on evolutionary finance, I found brilliant and more inclined to what a model for studying financial markets should be. You will be very pleased with the course if you are interested in finance and have a mathematical approach, given the many math proofs. However, you don't need to know them perfectly to get a good grade on the exam (there are a few questions, which are not exactly 1:1 proofs, but you need to have understood them to be able to answer). It is not necessary to study all the passages by heart, in fact I do not recommend it; if you understand the logic, the proofs are always similar and you will have no difficulty in understanding the concepts and succeeding in the exam.

From that perspective I would definitely recommend it for everybody who isn‚Äòt just looking for easy credits but wants actually to learn sth.  The exam, however, was weird. Probably the best example for bad test design I‚Äòve seen in a while; for various reasons. E.g., in one task you needed to derive an expression. Next, you had to evaluate this expression for several values (which was something a 7yo could do (* & + of some numbers), but granted a lot of points due to the fact it took a lot of time). Follow-up task was then to plot and interpret the obtained results. I.e., if you failed the first sub-task you were doomed. And there were plenty of other such examples in this exam.

But the lecturers do not know how to deal with the fact that half of the class does not know what a capacitor ist, so they move at breakneck speed. Beware of taking this class, it is way, WAY more work than you think. All lectures are relevant, but you will not understand any of them in class and will have to research how stuff works on your own. The labs will leave just enough time to make all measurements without interpreting them at all, so you‚Äôll have to answer all questions and plot missing graphs later at home. The prelab questions take just as much work, since you can only solve them once you actually understand the topic. No simple copy paste will help you! Googling will often be hard, since the topics covered are extremely niche, so get ready to read some papers instead of tutorials. The exam itself will ask you to interpret new situations, so simple fact memorization will not work.

The lecture is really good and the material is just so fascinating. You are expected to look up a lot of the material in the literature yourself, but when reading the Clayden and the papers distributed on Olat, it's possible to cover the most important parts. You should really try to attend the exercises since no solutions will be distributed and knowing the exercises is key to passing the exam. 3 exam questions were directly taken from the exercises this year and another one was directly from one of the papers that was suggested as reading material. So really try to study all exercises and the distributed reading material well!! Then a passing grade should be very much doable.  I don't get why other reviews say he really likes name reactions. Sure, he introduces them with their proper names in the lecture, but you are not expected to know the name reactions themselves, just what they do basically. Also in that regard I think it was much less memorizing by heart than OC II, it's really about understanding the mechanisms and orbital interactions (and knowing the exercises, sure).

Otherwise the lecture was great and also the project makes total sense in an advanced AI class. The expectations of the exam were also not very clear, we never had exercises in this course but in the exam we then had to solve some math questions which have not really been discussed in class. The math would not have been very difficult but since we never practiced it, it was a bit confusing. The course was the first time this year so I expect they will get better with organisation stuff.

620e83b5744aaa0021c6a5c3,"The topics of the course are extremely engaging once you understand them. But the lecturers do not know how to deal with the fact that half of the class does not know what a capacitor ist, so they move at breakneck speed. Beware of taking this class, it is way, WAY more work than you think. All lectures are relevant, but you will not understand any of them in class and will have to research how stuff works on your own. The labs will leave just enough time to make all measurements without interpreting them at all, so you‚Äôll have to answer all questions and plot missing graphs later at home. The prelab questions take just as much work, since you can only solve them once you actually understand the topic. No simple copy paste will help you! Googling will often be hard, since the topics covered are extremely niche, so get ready to read some papers instead of tutorials. The exam itself will ask you to interpret new situations, so simple fact memorization will not work.  On the plus side, the lecturers have studied under the guy who actually invented the field of neuromorphic engineering, so you‚Äôll learn from some of the world's leading experts in the field. The exam itself is also generous IF you understand the topics at hand. No really tricky questions, just honest and interesting reasoning through different scenarios. If you want to work as or with neuromorphic engineers, you HAVE to take this course, no other resource will bring you much knowledge. Similarly, if you really want to force yourself to finally learn how to read electric circuits, this course is the most pressure you can find. I‚Äôm certainly glad I took the course, even if I invested 12 ECTS worth of effort into it, since I now know more than I ever dreamt of about the topics at hand which really do interest me.

It is a shame that such a driven professor teaches this subject in a way that is so inaccessible to students. The entire course builds on understanding visualisation concepts, but rarely anything is taught in practice. Rather, the professor insists on hammering some theoretical concepts into our brains which I was personally not able to convert into practice. To my mind, data vis concepts should be taught by practice. That is, just code and plot data, as much as possible. But instead of this, you get a weird book which explains everything in a far too complicated manner without much practical relevance. Typical BWL 1-3 type of study which is hell for most students. But at least the grading was very generous because it did not matter if you understand anything but if you choose the right terms, and then I guess you easily get a 5.5 or more.

62a09d4230bb7f0021e91cde,This course is a mixed bag- on one hand the lecture provides quite a few interesting insights most of which however are very technical in nature.

Prof. Hoffmann is very passionate about Macro and seems like a nice guy but sometimes really struggles to break down the content and highlight the most important points. Both TA‚Äòs were top quality (much better than the guys in Micro 2). Problem sets were technical and got progressively harder- no written solutions were provided.

Only one mock exam is provided with no solutions. Furthermore you receive no written solutions for the problem sets apart from the often mistake ridden notes of the TA.

You‚Äôll have to get used to a lot of new mathematical notation and some lengthy derivations and proofs during the lectures (containing mathematical contents which have not been taught to such extent in undergrad Econ in Z√ºrich e.g. fix-Point Theorems and Hyperplane Separation etc.). The course feels to ambitious especially towards the end- way too much content in a very short time span. Lecturer is average and quite monotone and often rushes through the material due to time pressure. Exercise sessions were nice and quite useful for insights and exam preparation- beware they get progressively harder. In general the course requires a high workload and is amongst the toughest subjects at WWF in Z√ºrich. Exam is manageable with comprehensive preparation but requires a lot of transfer knowledge. Also be aware of the fact that in certain years the lecturers tend to give huge weights to exercises in the exam which were barely covered in the course and did not seem that relevant (this I must say was quite disappointing). Up to 40% fail the course- however a good median estimate would probably lie around 25% which is still a lot for a 5th semester course. Some interesting topics, a decent TA, average lecturer, provided materials are alright, exam tough but manageable- very difficult to get outstanding grades.

Theoretically, you can choose Assembly, but if you have time consuming courses like SoPra, I'd rather recommend something easy like Go or Kotlin. The difficulty of the assignments are comparable to the ones from Info 1, maybe a bit harder if you choose the 'wrong' language. The seminar paper must only contain three pages, so it isn't that much of a pain, especially since you could choose the language. Finally, the presentation of 10 minutes was very relaxed.

There are so many things that you kind of know as programmer, but dont really understand - partly because UZH does not teach it in depth. What is the difference between a dynamically and a static typed language? How does type-checking work? How does memory allocation and garbage collection work?  Knowing these things will make you feel a bit more competent as a programmer.  My advice: Visit the lectures and the exercises for the first 2 or 3 weeks and see if you feel ‚Äûthe vibe‚Äú of the lecture.",4,UZH,51107916,0.0,0.0,1658274555641,Foundations of Programming Languages and Program Analysis (L+E),Foundations of Programming Languages and Program Analysis
